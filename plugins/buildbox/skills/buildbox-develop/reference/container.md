# BuildBox container

BuildBox runs in Docker container to isolate build environment from host system.
This container runs **privilegied**.

![BuildBox container](/buildbox_container_structure.png)

The container is dedicated to a single project: one project, one container.
The container is named `bbx-<project_basename>-<hash>` where `<hash>` is derived from
the project root path, ensuring unicity per project location.

The project directory is mounted into the container at the same absolute path.
BuildBox sources are also mounted into the container, so they can be updated without recreating the container.

The BuildBox user UID and GID are mapped on host user identifiers.

Required build files are located in the `docker` directory:
- [Dockerfile](#dockerfile),
- `bin/bbx`: BuildBox host-side launcher, used to manage the container and run commands,
- `entrypoint.sh`: container entry point, to map UID / GID from host user.

## Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` builds the base image starting from a
[Debian 12 slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian) base.

It installs the common build toolchain (gcc, autotools, cmake, python3, git, …)
and the BuildBox runtime (user, sudo rules, udev, entrypoint).

A `Dockerfile.docker` variant extends the base image to add a full Docker
installation inside the container (see [Docker variant image](#docker-variant-image)).

## Build new image

### Base image

Every time `Dockerfile` is updated, a new base image has to be built.

From BuildBox sources `docker/` directory, run:
```
docker build --network="host" --no-cache --pull -t buildbox .
```

It creates a `buildbox:latest` image.
Tag it with the BuildBox version:
```
docker tag buildbox:latest buildbox:M.m.r
```

The tag `M.m.r` should follow the BuildBox release tag.

To start testing your changes with the newly created local image, stop any running project container using `bbx stop`, then run `bbx` from the project directory, it will pick up the new image.

Once everything is right, the local image can be pushed remotely to be used by
BuildBox users. By convention, the BuildBox sources commit used to build the
image is tagged `docker_M.m.r`.

### Docker variant image

The Docker variant image (`Dockerfile.docker`) extends the base image with a
full Docker installation (Docker Engine, Buildx, Compose, rootless extras).
Its purpose is to allow building Docker images from within a BuildBox container,
which is required by projects that orchestrate Docker builds as part of their
build process.

The base image must be built and tagged before building this variant.

From BuildBox sources `docker/` directory, run:
```
docker build --network="host" --no-cache -t buildbox-docker -f Dockerfile.docker .
```

Tag it with the same version as the base image:
```
docker tag buildbox-docker:latest buildbox-docker:M.m.r
```

To push to a registry:
```
docker push buildbox-docker:M.m.r
```

Projects that need Docker-in-Docker declare this image in their `.bbx/image`
file, or use a derived image that starts `FROM buildbox-docker:M.m.r`.

## Custom images

A project may use a custom Docker image instead of the official BuildBox image.
This is the recommended way to add project-specific tools, libraries, or
configurations that are not part of the standard BuildBox image.

### Creating a custom image

Custom images are built with a standard `Dockerfile` that starts `FROM` the
official BuildBox image:

```dockerfile
FROM buildbox:latest

# Example: install a project-specific toolchain
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    gcc-arm-none-eabi \
    binutils-arm-none-eabi \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Example: install Python packages
RUN pip install --break-system-packages pyserial==3.5

# Example: add custom configuration
COPY my-tool.conf /etc/my-tool.conf
```

Build and tag the image:

```bash
docker build -t mycompany/buildbox-custom:latest path/to/my-dockerfile/
docker tag mycompany/buildbox-custom:latest mycompany/buildbox-custom:2.1.0
```

To push to a private registry:

```bash
docker push mycompany/buildbox-custom:latest
```

To declare a custom image for a project, see [Custom Docker image](https://buildbox.trusted-objects.com/user/project.html#custom-docker-image).

### Container recreation

When `.bbx/image` changes (or is added/removed), the next `bbx` command
automatically stops the existing container and starts a new one using the
updated image. No manual `bbx stop` is required.

## TTY USB devices

To deal with USB TTY devices from BuildBox container, there are two involved
mechanisms:
- **udev**, to trigger events,
- **buildbox_tty_usb_sync** tool, located in BuildBox sources `docker/bin` directory.

This last tool is responsible of devices nodes synchronization between host and
BuildBox container. It is triggered by host-side udev rules (see
[TTY USB devices settings](https://buildbox.trusted-objects.com/getting-started/install.html#tty-usb-devices)).

Logs are written to syslog.
Assuming your system logs are readable through journalctl, you can read them
with:
```
journalctl -f -g "Buildbox USB TTY sync"
```
and you can see lines line this when a device is plugged:
```
oct. 09 17:56:29 darkknight buildbox_tty_usb_sync[2346574]: Buildbox USB TTY sync: added /dev/bus/usb/001/120 (189:119)
oct. 09 17:56:30 darkknight buildbox_tty_usb_sync[2346574]: Buildbox USB TTY sync: added /dev/ttyUSB0 (188:0)
```
and like this when a device is removed:
```
oct. 09 17:56:33 darkknight buildbox_tty_usb_sync[2346823]: Buildbox USB TTY sync: removed /dev/bus/usb/001/120
oct. 09 17:56:33 darkknight buildbox_tty_usb_sync[2346823]: Buildbox USB TTY sync: removed /dev/ttyUSB0
```
