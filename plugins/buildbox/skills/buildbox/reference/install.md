# Installation

## Requirements

The following tools must be installed on the host system before using BuildBox.

### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y bash make python3 curl git openssh-client
```

Docker must be installed separately following the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian).

**Tip:**
The preferred way to install Docker on Ubuntu or Debian is using the official Docker `apt` repository.

**Warning:**
Do not install Docker from Snap, and do not use Docker Desktop.

### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install -y bash make python3 curl git openssh
```

Docker must be installed separately following the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora).

### ArchLinux

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed bash make python curl git openssh docker
```

## Docker settings

To be able to manage Docker, ensure your user is in the `docker` group. If it is not the case, do:
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
```

and reconnect your session.

**Warning:**
On Ubuntu, it seems you have to reboot to refresh groups. So, if after reconnecting, the `groups` command does not show the `docker` group, you have to reboot.

## Install BuildBox

Get [BuildBox latest stable release](https://github.com/TrustedObjects/BuildBox/releases/latest).

Extract it, go to its directory, then install it system-wide:
```
sudo make install
```

This installs the `bbx` launcher to `/usr/local/bin` and all supporting files to
`/usr/local/share/buildbox`. A custom prefix can be passed if needed:
```
sudo make install PREFIX=/opt/buildbox
```

Then fetch the latest BuildBox container image from Docker Hub:
```
bbx image fetch
```

To verify everything works, go to a BuildBox project directory and run:
```
bbx --help
```

**Tip:**
Enable the [shell plugin](../user/shell_plugin.md) to display the active BuildBox
project and target in your prompt, get shell completion for `bbx` commands, and
have BuildBox environment variables automatically exported when you `cd` into a
project. It takes a single line in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

**Tip:**
Working with [Claude Code](../user/claude.md)? Run `bbx claude install` once to get the
BuildBox skills, so it knows the environment of your projects.

## SSH settings

If you access packages from private repositories, BuildBox is going to use your SSH client settings to clone them.
So, SSH client has to be configured correctly.

First of all, ensure you have an SSH key. If this is not the case, you have to generate one, without passphrase (leave it empty when asked):
```
ssh-keygen
```

**Warning:**
For now, BuildBox doesn't support SSH keys with passphrases, this is planned for later.

If you use SSH RSA keys, edit your `.ssh/config` file and add at the end:
```
Host *
    PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa
```

If you use SSH DSA keys, edit your `.ssh/config` file and add at the end:
```
Host *
    PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss
```

## TTY USB devices

If you plan to use TTY USB devices from BuildBox, you have to add the following udev rules on your host, in `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-buildbox.rules`:
```
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", RUN+="/usr/local/share/buildbox/docker/bin/buildbox_tty_usb_sync"
ACTION=="remove", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", RUN+="/usr/local/share/buildbox/docker/bin/buildbox_tty_usb_sync"
```
If you installed with a custom prefix, adjust the path accordingly.

Then, reload and trigger udev rules:
```
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```
